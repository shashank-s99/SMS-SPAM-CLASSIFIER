# SMS-SPAM-CLASSIFIER

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as spam or ham. The model was trained on a dataset of SMS messages, and it achieved an accuracy of 95% on the held-out test set.

# Project Overview
The project consists of the following steps:

1. Data preprocessing: The SMS messages were preprocessed to clean the data and remove any irrelevant characters or words.
2. Feature engineering: Features were extracted from the SMS messages, such as the presence or absence of certain keywords, the length of the message, and the number of punctuation marks.
3. Model selection and training: A variety of machine learning models were trained on the extracted features, and the best performing model was selected.
4. Model evaluation: The selected model was evaluated on a held-out test set to assess its performance.

# Results
The selected model achieved an accuracy of 95% on the held-out test set. This means that the model was able to correctly classify 95% of the SMS messages in the test set as spam or ham.

# Future Work
The model could be further improved by using a larger dataset and by training the model on more sophisticated machine learning algorithms. Additionally, the model could be deployed to a production environment to classify SMS messages in real time.

# Conclusion
This project has demonstrated the feasibility of using machine learning to classify SMS messages as spam or ham. The developed model achieved an accuracy of 95% on the held-out test set, which is promising for future work.
